    <h2 >DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR?</h2>
    <img src="images/Line 24.png" width="50%">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>You've made significant profits selling NFTs this year, 
      but haven't set aside funds to pay for your capital gains taxes. 
       
        </p1>
        <br>
        <br>
    <p1>Instead, you've used profits to reinvest into new NFTs or other cryptocurrencies.

    </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>At the same, you've purchased countless NFTs that have significantly lost their original 
      market value. In fact, most of them are probably worthless and unsaleable, 
      stashed away in the "hidden" folder of your Open Sea account.
      
      
        </p1>
        <br>
        <br>
    <p1>And with December 31st fast-approaching, you’re looking for a way 
      to claim them as losses against your capital gains. But how?
      
      </p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1>You can’t just transfer them to a burner wallet. That’s tax evasion. You can’t sell
          them below market value to a friend. That’s tax evasion too. You need to find a 
         third-party buyer. Fast. The problem is, nobody wants to buy 
         your devalued NFTs. Until now…</p1>

<p1 data-aos="zoom-in">There’s so much growth and opportunity being built in 
  the metaverse right now, but for many people in the real 
  world, the cost of entry is unattainable. Upcycled aims to bridge 
  the economic gap between these worlds. And whereas most 
  NFT projects right now are leading the charge in gaming and 
  entertainment, our vision of the metaverse will be focused on 
  education in the arts and finance.

  We sincerely believe in the potential of this project to change

            <div class="accordion-content">
<p>0.15 ETH. This cost will be factored into your capital losses too! The sole purpose of the Access Pass is to gain access to our private Discord channel. After you initiate a sales request, it loses its value. So just include it as part of your sales batch.

            <button id="accordion-button-3" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">How will Upcycled save me money on taxes?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
<p>By selling your NFTs to Upcycled, you will be able to recognize capital losses to offset your capital gains from other NFTs, cryptocurrency, stocks, etc. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <button id="accordion-button-4" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">How do I calculate my tax losses that I’ll recognize?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
<p>First, determine your cost basis in the NFT you will sell to us. This amount is the amount you purchased the NFT for, plus any gas fees and other transaction fees incurred. Your loss amount is your cost basis less our purchase price (0.00025 ETH) – essentially your cost basis becomes your tax loss recognized. </p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>We have exciting plans for all of your unwanted NFTs! Our initiatives include charitable donations, educational programming, museums, etc. Giving your NFT a second chance at making an impact never felt so good! </p>

            </span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>Tax loss harvesting is a process by which you sell property that has decreased in value since the time you purchased it, in an effort to recognize losses that will offset your taxable capital gains for the year. Tax loss harvesting will reduce your overall tax liability. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item" data-aos="zoom-in">
                <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Is tax loss harvesting legal?

                </span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                  <p>Yes! Tax loss harvesting is 100% legal. If you own an asset (like an NFT) that has decreased in value or is seemingly worthless, you can sell that NFT for any price you want, even 0.000001 ETH. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-item" data-aos="zoom-in">
                    <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">What is the WRONG way to tax loss harvest?
                    </span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                      <p>- Don’t ever transfer assets to another wallet that you control and report that as a “sale.” That is tax evasion.
                        <br>
                                                            - It is not recommended that you sell your worthless NFTs to a friend for 0.00025 ETH. Transactions need to be at “arms length” for the IRS to recognize your capital loss.
                                                            <br>
                                                            - Do not give worthless NFTs away for free and claim a loss. That is not a sale, the IRS views that as a gift, which is not tax deductible.
                                                            </p>
                    </div>

                        <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Is donating worthless NFTs to charity better?
                        </span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                        <div class="accordion-content">
                          <p>Not necessarily. When you donate an NFT, your tax-deduction is the fair market value of the asset at the time of donation. If that is effectively zero, your tax deduction will be zero. You want to donate to charity when the value of your assets are HIGH so that you can claim the full FMV as your deduction. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="accordion-item" data-aos="zoom-in">

                            <div class="accordion-content">
                              <p>You do. But don’t forget, the gas you incurred on the original purchase of your NFTs will be included in your cost basis – increasing your realizable loss upon sale to Upcycled and saving you $ in taxes! And since you have until midnight December 31st to send us your NFTs – the sooner you mint your Access Pass and start the transaction process, the more time you’ll have to transfer your NFTs during non-peak gas hours. </p>
                            </div>

                                <div class="accordion-content">
                                 <p> No problem. We can accommodate receiving your NFTs from two wallets. But your Upcycled Access Pass needs to be stored on one of them. </p>
